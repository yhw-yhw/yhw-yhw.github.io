I am a PhD student since Sep. 2020 at the [Perceiving Systems of the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://ps.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/) in Tübingen, Germany, supervised by Professor [Michael J. Black](https://ps.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/black). My research is in the area of 3D computer vision and focuses on understanding the interaction between human body and 3D scenes. I am especially interested in Implicit Neural Function, Face/Human Body Reconstruction and Multi-view Stereo. 

Before that, I achieved my master degree from [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/) in July 2020 and received my bachelor degree from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) in July 2017.
